Picture tweeter

The name YouLive is a take on you "tube". YouLive will be an SaaS that will broadcast and let you manipulate in any number of ways where your photos will end up being. 

To begin with, YouLive will source your picture from an email. If you send a picture to a designated YouLive account, the system will create a profile and login for you based on your phone number, then reply back a password for you.

Using the email account you used to first communicate with YouLive and the password sent to you you will be able to view and program what happens to the images you send to YouLive. For example, you can say, "directly post anything you get into my facebook account" .. or it can be more complex, like "For subject lines starting with "FAM" upload to my picasa account and create an album "FAM" (if not already there) and upload into the album

By default, the pictures will be selected to be displayed in the GUI. The GUI will be on the web browser and will basically be a public screensaver with latest image feeds coming from potentially all over the world
